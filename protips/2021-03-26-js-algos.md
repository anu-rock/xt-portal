If you are like me, whenever someone utters the a-word a 1000 volt
current passes through your body. Every time you tried to pick up a
book on the topic, you were repelled by 10 page long algorithms
implemented in Java.

This collection of cliched as well as brain-numbing algorithms
implemented in JavaScript should alleviate your misery a bit.

Thank me later.
