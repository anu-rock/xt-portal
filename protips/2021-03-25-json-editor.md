A nifty little web-based tool to quickly visualize your JSON. Very
handy for debugging API responses. Plus, itʼs open-source.

Thereʼs even a VS Code extension for it:

Bonus: How quickly can you create a desktop application out of this
web tool? Head to https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor for source
code, build your desktop app, and show off here.
